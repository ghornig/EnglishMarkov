# EnglishMarkov
A implementation of a word by word Markov chain to generate bodies of text. The parser must be run first to generate the two .p files, and then the constructor can be used as many times as necessary on the generated dictionaries.

The books used say first addition next to them, and that's not a typo it's because I called that branch "First Addition" to the project
and now it looks like I don't know the difference between edition and addition.
